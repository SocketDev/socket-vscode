/*
 * @file Code-as-law for John-David's public GitHub PR/issue comments — the
 *   voice rules distilled from the pnpm/rfcs#19 engagement (2026-08-06), so
 *   drafts get linted instead of re-litigated. Pipe a draft through before
 *   posting; exit 1 means fix it first. Each rule encodes the PATTERN behind
 *   a live correction on a posted comment, never the incident's exact words:
 *   gatekeeping the author's scope reads hostile; agreement words after 👍
 *   are redundant; em dashes read as AI tell; spec-speak loses readers;
 *   a question buried mid-paragraph gets skimmed past; a comment with
 *   nothing to apply or answer wastes the author's attention; and a
 *   standalone comment whose status words point outside itself ("still
 *   open") points at nothing. Fenced blocks are exempt from the prose rules because
 *   suggestion-block content becomes the TARGET DOCUMENT's text and must
 *   match its style (the pnpm RFCs use em dashes, for example).
 *   The message-vs-reaction decision tree (print with --rules):
 *
 *   1. Our finding, our ask, or a thread we are in: message.
 *   2. Agreeing with a bot finding on our review: a "👍 - ..." message, because a
 *      bare reaction is not in the message record.
 *   3. Someone else's thread, resolved our way, nothing to add: reaction only.
 *   4. Nothing to add, no position to signal: nothing. Usage: `node
 *      scripts/fleet/comment-voice.mts [--thread] [file]` (reads stdin when no
 *      file is given), or `--rules` to print the decision tree. The --thread
 *      flag permits referents ("still open", "still true") that only make
 *      sense inside a reply thread. Exit codes: 0 = clean (warnings allowed),
 *      1 = violations.

const RULES = `
Message rules (enforced):
  - 3 sentences max (WARN - clarity beats compression when they conflict)
  - questions lead; blank line; then context
  - every message is actionable: a suggestion block, a question, or a 👍 log
  - agreement format is "👍 - ..." (hyphen; the 👍 already means agreed)
  - regular hyphens only in prose; em dashes allowed inside fenced blocks
    (suggestion text mirrors the target document's style)
  - plain words; excitement not judgment; never gatekeep the author's scope
  - standalone comments are self-contained (no "still open" without a thread)

Reaction rule:
  - someone else's thread + resolution already matches our position + nothing
    to add = react (👍) on their resolving comment, do not post. A reaction
    signals "read and agreed" without inserting ourselves into their exchange.
